Phatt - PHP Android Translation Tool
Version 1.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created to ease translation work for Android appliations since I couldn't find
any real tools when looking around.

Based on strings-check.php by Marcin Orlowski <carlos@wfmh.org.pl> (2010-07-03)
Because of that, the tool is still a PHP CLI tool.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage

$ phatt res/values/strings.xml res/values-<langCode>/strings.xml

The basic form which will compare specific files (strings.xml, arrays.xml, etc)
for non-matching tags (string, string-array, array, plural) in either file.

$ phatt <langCode>

Run from within the project directory, this is a short-hand version of the above
that checks for res/values/strings.xml and res/values-<langCode>/strings.xml
(even works from within res) since this probably is the most common comparison.

$ phatt <langCode> i

With 'i' as a third argument, interactive mode is enabled. This will ask for
translations and update the res/values-<langCode>/strings.xml file and put the
translated strings in the right place in the file.
It will also provide a Google translation of the original string with a
possibility to accept it as-is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

To run the tool, PHP CLI is required.

For interactive mode, the following is required:
	* py-translate (https://sourceforge.net/projects/py-translate/)
	* GNU sed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation

The provided install.sh will install phatt and py-translate in /usr/local/bin
